  \begin{abstract}
  This is the official documentation for a series of interconnected programs written at Harvey Mudd during the summer of 2014 by John Allard and Alex Rich. The purpose of these programs is to successfully localize an actor in an environment using a preloaded 3D map, precomputed computer-vision related feature data, and a live image feed from an actor in the environment. The program starts with a large amount of guesses as to where the actor could be, and uses particle filtering to converge the particles upon the correct location in the environment. Read the research paper associated with this project for more information on the mathematics and other technicalities behind Monte Carlo Localization.

  \section{Introduction}
  Accomplishing the task of successfully locating an actor in an environment using CV-derived features and a 3D model requires many individual steps. The success of the localization attempt depends strongly on the computation and data storage that is done before any attempt is made. With this in mind, we dicided to subdivide the task of localizing an actor into a three separate programs that must be run individually. Two of them are done before the localization attempt and only needed to be run once for each map that an actor is attempting to localize itself in. The 3rd program is the actual localization code that matches features to figure out where the actor is in the given map.
