minx maxx miny maxy z delta theta

//_____________Explanation________________//
Line 3 is six floating point numbers separated by spaces that tell the program the plane it should taken images from.
The minx/maxx miny/maxy represent the outer bounds of a rectangle around your map. The z value is the height that all of these images should be taken from. Delta is the spacing of the grid, the distance along either the x or y axis to the next iamge rendering point. Theta is how much you want to rotate each time until 360 degrees for each point in the map
