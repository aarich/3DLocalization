This project is an small collection of programs that allow a general actor (most of the time a robot) to localize itself in a pre-mapped environment using image-based feature data and particle filtering via the [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_localization](Monte Carlo Localization algorithm.)

For in-depth documentation on the source code and project planning, see `/3DLocalization/Documentation/CodeDocumentation/`.
For documentation on our research project, see `/3DLocalization/Documentation/ResearchPaper`.
For a manual on how to operate the program, see `/3DLocalization/Documentation/UserManual`
